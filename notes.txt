Features to make:

- Concept of a card, with multiple sides, in javascript. 
	- Make a sample card, flip between the two sides.
- Backend. Card storage, somewhere. Use node? Hook the frontend up to make a getCards call.
- Implement the SM2 algorithm, I suppose in javascript as well
- Accounts, login, etc. Cards stored per account.
- Card creation

ex:
class Card {
	string front;
	string back;
}
